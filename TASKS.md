# Objectives for this Project

Create an Issue tracker with basic functionality as follows:
- [ ] create an issue with input as title, description and initial state as New
- [ ] Issue can be updated from New to In Progress, In Progress to Done.
- [ ] Each state to have is own swim lane, i.e., issues with similar states to be displayed together. (Kanban view is good to have but not mandatory)
- [ ] Update(title, description) and delete operation

Stretch goals:
- [ ] Integrate with github issues API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues). For repo parameter, you can use the repo to which you will be pushing this project. For delete, you can use lock endpoint.
